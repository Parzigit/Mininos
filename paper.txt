ABSTRACT
Deploying multiple controllers in the control panel of software-defined networks increases scalability, availability, and performance, but it also brings challenges, such as controller overload. To address this, load-balancing
techniques are employed in software-defined networks. Controller load balancing can be categorized into two
main approaches: (1) single-level thresholds and (2) multi-level thresholds. However, previous studies have
predominantly relied on single-level thresholds, which result in an imprecise classification of controllers or
have assumed uniform controller capacities in multi-level threshold methods. This study explores controller
load balancing with a focus on utilizing multi-level thresholds to accurately assess controller status. Switch
migration operations are utilized to achieve load balancing, considering factors such as the degree of load
imbalance of the target controller and migration efficiency. This includes evaluating the post-migration status
of the target controller and the distance between the migrating switch and the target controller to select
the appropriate target controller and migrating switch. The proposed scheme reduces controller response
time, migration costs, communication overhead, and throughput rate. Results demonstrate that our scheme
outperforms others regarding response time and overall performance.

1. Introductions
Software-defined networks facilitate network management by vertically dividing the network into three planes, including the data plane,
the control plane, and the application plane [1,2]. The controller
domain in the data plane contains several switches that are managed by
that controller [3]. The communication between the controller and the
data plane is through the user interface, the most common OpenFlow
user interface. OpenFlow helps speed up controller management [4].
The control panel consists of multiple controllers arranged in a distributed manner [5], each interconnected to monitor the network’s status. However, these controllers can themselves become overloaded [6].
The need for multi-controller load balancing in SDN environments
arises from the growing demand to manage an increasing number of
devices and network traffic. Traditional network architectures, which
rely on distributed control planes, may struggle to scale effectively and
handle these rising demands. Multi-controller load balancing addresses
this challenge by distributing the control plane workload across multiple controllers, thereby enhancing network scalability, availability, and
the ability to manage a larger volume of devices and traffic [7]. One
approach to mitigating controller load imbalance in Software-Defined
Networking (SDN) environments is switch migration [8]. This method

involves transferring a switch from the domain of an overloaded controller to that of an underloaded controller, thereby optimizing load
distribution and improving overall network performance.
Despite the potential of switch migration operations and multicontroller frameworks, several gaps remain in the existing research.
First, many approaches rely on simplistic single-level thresholds or
assume uniform controller capacities, leading to inaccuracies in dynamic environments. Second, the high cost of switch migration often
remains unaddressed, resulting in suboptimal network performance.
Finally, current load evaluation methods frequently overlook the importance of using multiple metrics, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and bandwidth, to comprehensively assess controller loads.
These gaps highlight the need for a more accurate, efficient, and
practical load-balancing framework for software-defined networks.
Recent advancements in software-defined networks (SDNs) and
their extension to satellite networks highlight the growing complexity
and potential of these systems. The integration of multi-domain networks in the 6G era, aimed at supporting applications like extended
reality (XR) and holographic communications, faces challenges such
as domain isolation and resource inefficiencies [9]. Similarly, studies
in software-defined satellite networks emphasize the importance of
optimizing multi-controller placement using meta-heuristic approaches,

such as the Adaptive Virtual Bee Optimization Algorithm (AVOA), to
enhance network reliability and control delay [10]. Furthermore, techniques like Virtual Network Request Load Balancing Profit (VNR_LBP)
demonstrate the ability to mitigate congestion by virtualizing switches
and optimizing resource utilization, leading to notable improvements in
throughput, delay, and cost efficiency [11]. These recent developments
underscore the necessity of robust frameworks to address the dynamic
requirements of modern SDNs and their satellite counterparts.
This article focuses on load balancing among controllers in softwaredefined networks, aiming to accurately determine controller statuses
using multiple thresholds while accounting for their varying capacities. To achieve efficient load distribution, switch migration operations
are employed, strategically grouping controllers at different levels to
minimize unnecessary migrations. Given the high cost associated with
switch migrations, the approach prioritizes reducing migration overhead by selecting the most suitable switch and target controller with
optimal efficiency. The proposed framework’s performance is evaluated
based on response time criteria through the design and implementation
of various scenarios.
In this regard, the main contributions of this study are as follows:

framework. This framework explores the use of software-defined networks (SDN) with multiple controllers to enhance reliability and scalability in Edge Computing (EC) environments, particularly in the context
of the Internet of Things (IoT). The proposed ESMLB framework focuses
on efficient switch migration for load balancing, addressing issues such
as uneven load distribution among controllers and suboptimal performance caused by dynamic network demands and changing topologies.
By using a decision analysis method to rank controllers based on
criteria such as memory usage and CPU load, ESMLB seeks to optimize
resource utilization and improve overall performance in SDN-based IoT
systems.
Zafar et al. [15] have introduced a dynamic switch migration-based
load balancing (DSMLB) approach to tackle the challenges associated
with managing Internet of Things (IoT) traffic in Software-Defined
IoT (SD-IoT) networks. This framework proposes a dynamic switch
migration strategy to optimize load balancing performance, addressing the limitations of existing techniques in handling real-time traffic variations and diverse network topologies. By implementing the
DSMLB framework, the authors aim to enhance load balancing by
dynamically transferring switches from overloaded to underutilized
controllers, considering key metrics like controller input overhead, control plane request rate, and capacity. Through experimental testing on
the Mininet platform with the RYU controller, the DSMLB mechanism
shows significant enhancements in reducing controller response time,
and migration cost, and improving control plane load balancing efficiency compared to standard methods, underscoring its effectiveness in
managing controller workload within SD-IoT architectures. The authors
of [16] address the issue of uneven load distribution among distributed
controllers in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) by introducing a dynamic and adaptive load balancing mechanism. The mechanism utilizes
a hierarchical control plane to estimate the load of each controller
based on controller and switch factors. The article [17] addresses
the issue of load imbalance in the software-defined networking (SDN)
control plane by proposing switch migration as a solution. This involves
moving switches from overloaded controllers to underutilized ones to
improve network performance and resource utilization.
Ref. [18] presents GLBMF, a load-balancing method driven by
greediness that focuses on reducing switch migrations and giving
priority to low-traffic mice flows. GLBMF operates by redistributing
switches from heavily loaded controllers to lightly loaded ones when
the deviation from the average load surpasses a predefined threshold.
Moreover, it gives precedence to switches with minimal mice-flow
traffic for relocation to minimize network-wide packet losses. Experimental results indicate that GLBMF surpasses conventional methods in
terms of throughput, switch movements, response time, and packet loss
mitigation. In the paper [19], a holonic multi-agent-based approach
is introduced to solve the controller placement problem in SDN-SG
networks. Using this method, the time complexity of the problem
is significantly reduced, and load balancing is effectively distributed
across the network.

1. Development of a Multi-level Approach for Determining Controller Status: This paper introduces an innovative method for
accurately determining the load status of controllers using multiple thresholds. This approach significantly enhances the precision
in identifying overloaded and underloaded controllers.
2. Load Calculation of Controllers Using Multiple Metrics: We propose a method for calculating the load on controllers that incorporates three key metrics: CPU usage, memory consumption, and
bandwidth utilization. This approach allows for a more precise
assessment of the load status of controllers and facilitates optimal
load distribution.
3. Optimized Switch Migration Operations: This research investigates and optimizes the switch migration operations. By employing novel techniques, switches selected for migration are
strategically chosen to reduce the load on overloaded controllers,
thus improving the network’s overall efficiency.
The structure of the paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 covers
related works, while Section 3 elaborates on the proposed scheme.
Section 4 details the evaluation and implementation setup and discusses
the performance results. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions of
the study.
2. Related works
In this section, we introduce the related works that have addressed
the load balancing of controllers. Load balancing in software-defined
networks has been widely studied under two main approaches: singlethreshold and multi-threshold methods. Single-threshold methods define a specific threshold to classify controllers as overloaded or underloaded, while multi-threshold methods use multiple levels to assess
controller states more dynamically and accurately.

2.2. Multi threshold
Ref. [20], they have proposed the migration switch scheme of Multi
Threshold Load Balancing (MTLB). This design first sets the multilevel threshold and then determines the status of the controllers, if the
controller level changes, the rest of the controllers are notified, and
finally, by carefully studying the behavior of the migrant switch and the
target controller, it has provided a method for the migration operation.
Based on the articles that have been explained and a comparison
has been made between them in Table 1, most of the articles in the
field of controller load balancing have problems of a single domain,
high switch migration cost, lack of selection of the appropriate target controller, and computational complexity. First, we deal with the
problem of a single province. Single states do not provide accurate classification of controllers, leading to inefficient load balancing. However,

2.1. Single threshold
Ref. [12] suggests a software-defined multiple load balancing strategy that relies on response time. This approach first measures the
response time of the controllers. The controller’s response time determines the threshold and is divided into overload and underload
controllers. Ref. [13], Xiang et al. proposed a deep reinforcement
learning architecture for software-defined networks to solve the switch
migration problem. In this paper, a model is designed for DDQN,
which decides how to transfer switches between controllers. Ref. [14]
introduces an efficient switch migration-based load balancing (ESMLB)

the paper [20] adopted a multi-threshold approach by considering the
number of incoming packets to the controller, which does not provide
a precise criterion for evaluating the controller load. However, in this
article, the problem is that all controllers have the same capacity.
Therefore, to solve this problem, in this article, an attempt has been
made to use controllers with different capacities and combine them
with the multi-level threshold approach to provide accurate scaling
and classification of controllers. In addition, in this plan, for accurate
measurement of the controller load, CPU consumption criteria, memory
usage, and bandwidth are used to evaluate the controller load. Then,
by an algorithm that does not have the complexity of calculations; the
target switch and the appropriate target controller are selected to solve
the problem of choosing the proper target controller and the problem
of high switch migration costs.

3.2. Framework flowchart
The operational flow of the proposed DLBMT framework is illustrated in Fig. 2, which outlines the step-by-step load balancing process,
from load monitoring to switch migration.
1. Load measurement of the controller: The controller load is calculated based on CPU usage, memory, and bandwidth metrics.
The controller load is a numerical value between 0 and 100.
2. Multilevel threshold: Four thresholds are available for determining the controller level: idle level, normal level, high load
level, and overload level. Subsequently, the controller’s level is
determined based on its load.
3. Notify controller: If the controller’s level changes, other controllers are informed.
4. Status of the controller: When a controller is at the normal
level, it can manage the domain effectively. However, when a
controller is in the idle, high load, or overload level, a switch
migration operation is executed if a suitable migration switch
and target controller pair are available.
5. Ratio of the switch’s consumed resources to the distance of
the switch from the controller: For load balancing operations,
the ratio of the resources consumed by the source controller
to the distance between the switch and the source controller is
calculated.
6. Selecting appropriate migration switches from the available
switches within the domain of the source controller: The calculated value is compared for all switches within the domain to
the average resources consumed by the source controller to the
distance between the switch and the source controller. Switches
that have a higher resource consumption ratio compared to the
average for the source controller are added to the migration
switch set.
7. Determining the target controller’s load status (whether it is
operating at a normal or idle level): Non-source controllers in
the idle or normal level are selected as target controllers.
8. Determining the target controller’s load status (whether it is
operating at a normal or idle level): The load levels for the target
controllers after switch migration are calculated for each switch
in the migration switch set.
9. Determining the source controller’s load status after the switch
migration.
10. Removing the controller from the list of suitable target controllers of the switch: If a target controller is not in the idle or
normal level after switch migration, it is removed from the list
of target controllers for the switch in the migration switch set.

3. Proposed framework
In this section, we will describe the proposed plan. The CPU, memory, and bandwidth criteria are used to calculate the controller load in
this plan. Next, the controller load is compared against the multi-level
thresholds to determine the controller’s level. Based on the load level
of the controller, which is at a high load level or overloaded, the switch
migration operation is performed.
3.1. System model
As you can see in Fig. 1, the system model of the proposed design
includes several controllers in the control plane, where each controller
in the data plane contains a domain. The domain of each controller also
includes several switches, the number of switches in the domain of each
controller is based on the capacity of that controller. The controllers
are also connected so that each controller is independently aware of
the status of the entire network.
The network consists of switches and controllers. Let 𝐶 = {𝑐1 , 𝑐2 , … ,
𝑐𝑗 , … , 𝑐𝐾 } represent the set of controllers, where 𝐾 denotes the total
number of controllers in the network. Similarly, 𝑆 = {𝑠1 , 𝑠2 , … , 𝑠𝑖 , … ,
𝑠𝑁 } represents the set of switches, with 𝑁 as the total number of
switches in the network. As mentioned earlier, each controller manages a specific subset of switches. Consequently, the total number of
switches within the domain of controller 𝑐𝑗 is denoted as 𝑁 ′ . The
notation 𝑠𝑗𝑖 refers to a switch located within the domain of controller
𝑐𝑗 . As illustrated in Fig. 1, which depicts the flowchart of the prediction
algorithm, the process begins with measuring the controller’s load.
In the second step, a multi-level threshold mechanism is applied to
classify controllers into different levels. The third step involves the
load balancing operation, which, if necessary, includes selecting an
appropriate target switch, identifying a suitable target controller, and
finally, executing the switch migration process.

11. Calculating the degree of load imbalance between the source
controller and the target controller: For the remaining target
controllers, the degree of load imbalance between the source
controller and the target controller is calculated.
12. Choose the most appropriate target controller for each switch
and save it: For the remaining target controllers, the degree of
load imbalance between the source controller and the target
controller is calculated. Among the target controllers in the
migration switch set, the target controller with the least load
imbalance degree is selected as the suitable target controller for
the switch. This pair of the target controller and switch is stored
in a set.
13. Any pair with a lower efficiency is selected for the migration
operation: If the migration switch set and target controller set
are not empty, the migration efficiency is calculated for all
available pairs in the set. The target controller and migration
switch with the least migration efficiency are selected for the
switch migration operation.
14. Turn on a controller or add a controller to the network or do
not have switch migration: If the migration switch set and target
controller set are empty, and the source controller is idle or at
a high load level, no switch migration operation is performed.
However, if the source controller is at the overload level and
there is a previously turned-off controller available, it is turned
on, and the load-balancing operation is carried out. Otherwise,
a new controller is added to the network.

the respective consumption of CPU, memory, and bandwidth by switch
𝑠𝑗𝑖 on controller 𝑐𝑗 . Meanwhile, 𝐶𝑃 𝑈 , 𝑀𝑒𝑚, and 𝐵𝑤 represent the
total capacities of CPU, memory, and bandwidth for the controllers.
The coefficients 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 are used in the calculation, with their sum
equaling one. Eq. (2) calculates the total resources consumed by the
switches connected to controller 𝑐𝑗 . Eq. (3) then converts this total
into a percentage, yielding a value between one and one hundred.
This calculated value for each controller 𝑐𝑗 represents the load of the
controller.

3.3.1. Load measurement
To ensure efficient network management, it is crucial to accurately
measure the load on each controller. The load measurement process
involves evaluating the resource consumption of the controllers based
on interactions with their associated switches. This section presents
the proposed method for calculating controller load, focusing on CPU,
memory, and bandwidth usage. In the first step, the controller load
is calculated using the proposed design. To calculate the load of the
controller, first, the consumption of CPU, memory, and bandwidth of
each controller is calculated by the packet-in requests of the switches
in the domain of that controller, which is as follows:

3.3.2. Multi-level threshold
After calculating the controller load, the controller’s level is determined. As mentioned earlier, the controller load is a value between
0 and 100. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the value of 100 is divided into
four levels, with three thresholds: the first threshold is 25, the second
is 50, and the third is 75. If the controller’s load is less than the first
threshold (i.e., between 0 and 25), it is classified as idle. If the load is

between 25 and 50, the controller is considered to be at a normal level.
If the load is between the second and third thresholds (i.e., between
50 and 75), the controller is classified as having a high load. At this
level, if conditions permit, a switch migration operation is performed.
Finally, if the controller’s load exceeds the third threshold (above 75),
it is classified as overloaded, and a switch migration operation must

be executed. This operation is carried out even if there is no target
controller for migration; in such cases, a new controller is added to
the network.
In Algorithm 1, the process of determining the controller level has
been performed. In this algorithm, the controller load, the current level
of the controller (denoted by 𝑞𝑗 ), and the list of levels are taken as

inputs. The list of levels, Q[i], includes four values: Q[1]=25, Q[2]=50,
Q[3]=75, and finally Q[4]=100. The algorithm’s output is a new level
for the controller and a boolean value that indicates whether the level
of the controller has changed or not.
In line 3 of the algorithm, a loop is created to consider all the
controllers in the network. In line 4, there is an internal loop for the
levels, with a maximum value of 4. In lines 5 and 6, the new controller
load variable is set to zero, and the current load of the controller is also
checked. In line 7, there is an IF condition for comparing the controller
load with the levels to determine the level of the controller.
Based on the example network depicted in Fig. 1, which consists
of three controllers, each with multiple switches in its domain: in the
domain of controller 𝑐1 , there are four switches ⟨𝑠11 , 𝑠12 , 𝑠13 , 𝑠14 ⟩; in the
domain of controller 𝑐2 , there are three switches ⟨𝑠21 , 𝑠22 , 𝑠23 ⟩; and in the
domain of controller 𝑐3 , there are two switches ⟨𝑠31 , 𝑠32 ⟩. The controller
loads are 𝐿𝑅𝑐1 = 76, 𝐿𝑅𝑐2 = 47, and 𝐿𝑅𝑐3 = 21.
The level determination algorithm is applied to all three controllers,
resulting in the following classifications: controller 𝑐1 is in the overload
level, controller 𝑐2 is at the normal level, and controller 𝑐3 is in the idle
level. To determine the level for controller 𝑐2 with a load of 47, the
controller’s load is first compared with 𝑄[1] (which is 25). Since the
condition is met, the variable 𝑖 is incremented by 1, and the load is then
compared with 𝑄[2] (which is 50). The condition holds again because
47 < 50. As a result, in line 6, the value of 𝑖 (which is 2) is stored in
the 𝑐𝑗 variable, and the loop terminates.
When the value of 𝑐𝑗 is equal to 1, it indicates that the controller is
in the idle state. If 𝑐𝑗 = 2, the controller is at a normal level. If 𝑐𝑗 = 3,
the controller is at a high-load level, and finally, if 𝑐𝑗 = 4, the controller
is in an overload state. In line 11, the new controller level is compared
with its current level. If the level has changed, the algorithm outputs a
value of True; otherwise, it outputs False.

levels of the controllers are assessed, any changes in a controller’s load
level will trigger notifications to the other controllers. If a controller
in the network is operating at an under-load level, we will attempt to
deactivate it based on the network conditions.
If, in addition to the source controller operating at an under-load
level, there is another controller in the network that is either at
an under-load or normal load level, and this controller continues to
operate at an under-load or normal level after the switch migration
operation, the migration will be executed, and the source controller
will be deactivated.
When a controller operates at a normal load level, it indicates that
the controller can effectively manage its domain, and efforts will be
made to sustain the controllers’ loads in the network at this level.
In contrast, if a controller reaches a high load level, it signifies that
the controller is approaching overload, prompting the execution of
load balancing operations for controllers at this high load threshold.
To perform load balancing operations for controllers at a high load
level, we first calculate, for all switches in the domain of the high-load
controller, the ratio of total resource usage by switch 𝑠𝑗𝑖 in the domain
of controller 𝑐𝑗 to the distance of switch 𝑠𝑗𝑖 from the controller 𝑐𝑗 . This
is done using the following Eq. (4):

sumption to the distance of the switch from the controller, while £ 𝑗𝑖
denotes the total resource consumption of controller 𝑐𝑗 by switch 𝑠𝑗𝑖
in its domain. ℎ𝑚𝑖 represents the distance of switch 𝑠𝑗𝑖 from controller
𝑐𝑗 . We then calculate the average value of this ratio for all switches in
the domain of controller 𝑐𝑗 and store the value of 𝜓𝑠𝑗 for each switch
𝑖
in an array. If the value exceeds the average, the array containing
switches selected from the source controller’s domain is referred to as
the migration switch array.

In Eq. (5), the value 𝐿𝑅∗ 𝑐𝑗 represents the load of the source controller 𝑐𝑗 after the migration of the selected switch 𝑠𝑗𝑖 from the migration switch array. In this equation, 𝐿𝑅𝑐𝑗 , which denotes the load of

the source controller 𝑐𝑗 , is subtracted by £ 𝑗𝑖 , which indicates the total
resource consumption by the switch 𝑠𝑗𝑖 on the controller 𝑐𝑗 . Since £ 𝑗𝑖
is a value between 0 and 1, it is multiplied by 100 in this formula to
yield a value between 0 and 100. In Eq. (6), 𝐿𝑅∗𝑐 represents the load
𝑘
of the target controller 𝑐𝑘 after the migration of the switch. The term
£ 𝑘𝑖𝑗 indicates the resource consumption of the selected switch 𝑠𝑗𝑖 from
the migration switch array on the target controller. In this equation,
𝐿𝑅𝑐𝑘 , which denotes the load of the target controller 𝑐𝑘 , is added to £ 𝑘𝑖𝑗 ,
representing the total resource consumption of controller 𝑐𝑘 by switch

3.3.3. Load balancing
This section discusses the controller load balancing operation, with
the goal of maintaining the controller load at a normal level. Once the

Eq. (8), the degree of load imbalance between the source controller
𝑐𝑗 and the target controller 𝑐𝑘 is calculated for the switch 𝑠𝑗𝑖 , and 𝐿𝑅∗
represents the average load of the controllers after migration.
We first identify and pair each controller that remains idle or in a
normal state after the migration of switch 𝑠𝑗𝑖 and store these pairs in
a separate array. Since multiple target controllers may be available for
a given switch, we evaluate all possible pairs and select the controller
with the lowest degree of load imbalance. In other words, we choose
the most suitable target controller for each switch and save the selected
pair. If no valid switch-controller pairs are found, the process stops.
Otherwise, the migration efficiency is calculated for all pairs, and the
one with the highest efficiency is chosen for the migration operation.
The efficiency calculation is as follows:

∣ 𝐷𝐶(𝑐∗ ,𝑐 ) − 𝐷𝐶(𝑐𝑗 ,𝑐𝑘 ) ∣

load state. Following this, the resource consumption of both the source
controller and the destination controller after migration is calculated.
The load level of the destination controller after migration is then determined. If the destination controller falls into a high-load or overload
state after migration, it is removed from the list of potential target
controllers. Conversely, if the destination controller remains in an idle
or normal load state, the degree of imbalance in resource consumption
between the source and destination controllers is calculated.
In this example, switches 𝑠11 and 𝑠12 are selected for migration. Controllers 𝑐2 and 𝑐3 are considered potential target controllers. First, the
resource consumption of the source controller and potential destination
controllers after the migration is calculated for switch 𝑠11 . Specifically,
𝐿𝑅𝑐1 = 56, 𝐿𝑅𝑐2 = 78, and 𝐿𝑅𝑐3 = 46. Since controller 𝑐2 enters the
overload level after migration, switch 𝑠11 is removed from the list of
potential destination controllers. Therefore, the only remaining viable
pair is switch 𝑠11 and controller 𝑐3 . The same process is repeated for
switch 𝑠12 , with the following values: 𝐿𝑅𝑐1 = 47, 𝐿𝑅𝑐2 = 90, and
𝐿𝑅𝑐3 = 55. In this case, both controllers 𝑐2 and 𝑐3 enter the overload
level after migration, meaning neither of them can be considered as a
potential destination controller.
Finally, to select the best pair of switches and controllers for migration, the pairs with the highest migration rate are selected according to
steps 30–35. If there are multiple pairs of switches and controllers for
migration, the pair with the highest migration rate is selected. In this
example, the pair (𝑠12 , 𝐶3 ) with a migration rate of 0.009 is selected.
After selecting the pair of switches and controller for migration and
saving them in Y, steps 25–29 of the algorithm stop the migration
operation if =0 and the source controller is in the idle or normal level,
as a suitable destination controller has not been found. However, if
the source controller is in the high or overload level, the previously
turned-off controllers are turned on again or the network is expanded
and additional controllers are added to the network.

As you can see, the migration efficiency is calculated in Eq. (9),
which is calculated by deducting the difference in the degree of load
imbalance between the source controller 𝑐𝑗 and the target controller
𝑐𝑘 after the switch migration operation and the load imbalance degree
between the source controller 𝑐𝑗 and the target controller ck before
the operation. Switch migration is calculated and divided by migration
cost. In this formula, 𝜗𝑗,𝑘 represents migration efficiency and 𝐷𝐶(𝑐∗ ,𝑐 ) )
𝑗 𝑘
represents the degree of load imbalance between two controllers before
the migration operation, and 𝑓(𝑠𝑗 ,𝑐 ) represents Pays for immigration.
𝑖 𝑘
Eq. (10), the cost of migration is calculated by multiplying the amount
of resources consumed by the migrator switch 𝑠𝑗𝑖 from the target
controller ck by the distance between the migrator switch 𝑠𝑗𝑖 and the
target controller ck. In this formula, ℎ𝑖𝑘 represents the distance of
switches 𝑠𝑗𝑖 to the target controller ck. Finally, each migrating switch
and target controller that has the lowest efficiency is selected for the
switch migration operation.
For the controllers that are overloaded, we also have the switch
migration operation. All the steps to perform the switch migration operation are the same as for the controllers that are overloaded, with the
difference that if the switch array and the appropriate target controller
were empty, if we had a switched-off controller in the network We
turn it on and perform the migration operation. Otherwise, we add a
controller to the network and perform the switch migration operation.
Algorithm 2 for load balancing between controllers using switch
migration is for controllers that are in idle, high, or overload levels.
Controllers at the normal level can manage their domains well. In steps
2–9, switches in the domain of the source controller that are suitable
for migration are stored. In step 2, there is a loop for all switches
in the domain of the source controller. In step 3, the ratio of the
resources consumed by the switch to the distance from the switch to the
source controller is calculated using formula (4). Then, in step 5, the
total resources consumed by the switch from the source controller are
calculated. After performing calculations for all switches in the domain
of the source controller, the average resources consumed by the switch
from the source controller are calculated in step 6. Then, using the
condition in step 7, any switch that has a value greater than the average
is stored in the P array.
In the given example, controller 𝑐1 is in an overload state, and
to achieve balance in the network, load-balancing operations must be
carried out for controller 𝑐1 . Initially, the resource consumption of
all switches in the domain of controller 𝑐1 is calculated, yielding the
following values: < 20, 14, 7, 6 >. Next, the values of 𝜓𝑠𝑗 are computed:
𝜓𝑠𝑗 = 47 and 𝜓𝑠𝑗 = 12. Since switches 𝑠11 and 𝑠12 have higher resource
consumption than the average, they are stored in the migration array,
denoted as 𝜌.
After selecting the appropriate switches for migration, the next step
is to identify a suitable destination controller. The primary condition
for a destination controller is that it must be in either an idle or normal

4. Proposed framework
4.1. Experimental setup
The proposed Distributed Load Balancing Mechanism for Controllers
(DLBMT) has been evaluated using the NS2 framework, demonstrating
a high level of authenticity. Within the DLBMT scheme, we selected
RYU [15] as the experimental controller. RYU is an OpenFlow controller that is implemented in the Python programming language. The
simulation experiments were carried out on a PC equipped with an
Intel Core i7 CPU and 12 GB of RAM. Additionally, the study calculated
the average resource demand of PACKET-IN messages using the Iperf
tool [16].
The performance of the proposed DLBMT mechanism was evaluated
by applying it to modern network topologies in real-time scenarios,
including Interroute and ARN, sourced from the Topology-zoo website.
Furthermore, we incorporated the Atlanta and Germany50 topologies
from the SND-lib, each with varying scales, to assess the effectiveness of
the MTDLB methodology. A detailed summary of the network topology
characteristics is provided in Table 3.

4.2.2. Performance evaluation of migration cost
The migration cost is defined as the total resource expenditure
incurred during the transfer of a switch, which includes the time taken
for the migration, the bandwidth utilized, and any degradation in
network performance resulting from the migration process. Migration
cost in controller load balancing refers to the cost associated with
moving a switch from one controller to another. This cost can include
several factors, such as the time required to migrate the switch, the
bandwidth consumed during the migration, and the impact on network
performance during the migration. Minimizing migration cost is crucial
in controller load balancing because frequent migrations can increase
network overhead and reduce performance. To minimize migration
costs, load balancing algorithms typically consider factors such as
the current load on each controller, the available resources on each
controller, and the migration cost associated with moving a switch from
one controller to another.
By carefully balancing the load among controllers and minimizing
migration costs, we can ensure that the network operates efficiently and
effectively, while also minimizing the impact on network performance
and reducing energy consumption. Yes, as shown in Fig. 5, the migration cost of the proposed strategy is lower than the other four strategies
in all topologies. This indicates that the proposed strategy is effective in
selecting the appropriate switch and controller for migration, resulting
in lower migration costs and improved network performance.

4.2.3. Degree of load imbalance performance evaluation
The degree of load imbalance between controllers in controller load
balancing refers to the difference in resource consumption or workload
between controllers in a network. Load-balancing algorithms aim to
distribute the workload or resource consumption evenly among the
available controllers to improve network performance and efficiency.
A high degree of load imbalance can lead to longer response times,
decreased network availability, and higher energy consumption. By
monitoring the degree of load imbalance and implementing appropriate
load-balancing techniques, network administrators can ensure that the
workload is distributed evenly among the available controllers, leading
to improved network performance and reduced energy consumption.
In this section, the degree of imbalance in load strategy DLBMT
and four other strategies (DSMLB, DHA, DLBM, SMSC) are compared
in four different topologies. The proposed strategy has the least degree
of imbalance in load in all topologies and under increasing transmission
rates of PACKET-IN messages. As shown in Fig. 6, the degree of load
imbalance of the DLBMT strategy is lower than that of the other
strategies under varying network loads.

4.2.4. The control plane load balancing rate
The control plane load balancing rate is a critical metric in softwaredefined networking (SDN) that measures the effectiveness and efficiency of distributing control loads across multiple controllers. This
rate indicates how quickly and effectively the load is balanced across
the control plane, ensuring that no single controller becomes overwhelmed while others remain underutilized. The importance of the
control plane load balancing rate can be summarized as follows: A
higher load balancing rate can enhance overall network performance
by reducing response times and minimizing the likelihood of bottlenecks. Additionally, effective load balancing contributes to higher
network reliability; should a controller fail or become overloaded, the
system can swiftly redistribute the load to other controllers, thereby
maintaining continuous network operation. Furthermore, efficient load
balancing optimizes resource utilization across controllers, leading to
lower operational costs and improved energy efficiency. Several factors
influence the control plane load balancing rate, as shown in Fig. 7.

To evaluate the DLBMT performance, we compare it with four
different schemes: DSMLB[11], SMSC[12], DLBM [13], DHA [14].
4.2. Simulation analysis
4.2.1. Performance evaluation of average response time
The response time criterion is utilized to evaluate the performance
of the controller, as an increase in response time indicates an unbalanced load on the controller. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the proposed
DLBMT algorithm demonstrates a shorter response time compared to
the DSMLB, DHA, DLBM, and SMSC algorithms across various topologies, including Atlanta, ARN, Germany50, and Interroute. The response

Several factors influence reliability. One key factor is redundancy;
the presence of backup controllers can significantly enhance the
network’s reliability by providing alternative options in case of a
controller failure. Additionally, the efficiency of load balancing
plays a vital role in ensuring reliability. Efficient load balancing helps prevent overloads, which can lead to system failures,
thereby contributing to a more stable and dependable network
operation.
• CPU Consumption: CPU consumption is defined as the amount
of processing power utilized by the controllers and switches to
manage network operations. Several factors influence CPU consumption in a network environment. One significant factor is the
complexity of algorithms used for load balancing and routing;
more complex algorithms typically consume more CPU resources
as they require additional processing power to execute efficiently.
Additionally, traffic volume plays a crucial role in determining
CPU consumption; as traffic volumes increase, the need for processing also rises to maintain optimal performance levels across
the network.
• Memory Consumption: Memory consumption measures the
amount of memory used by network devices to store routing
tables, flow entries, and other necessary data.

4.2.5. Performance evaluation of communication overhead
In controller load balancing, communication overhead refers to the
extra data and traffic that is generated by the controllers as they
communicate with each other to balance the load. This communication
overhead can impact the performance of the network, as it consumes
bandwidth and processing resources that could otherwise be used for
data transmission.
The proposed strategy results in less communication overhead between controllers and between controller-switch pairs compared to
other strategies. The controller-to-controller communication overhead
is very low due to multiple thresholds and sending messages to other
controllers in case of a controller level change, as shown in Fig. 8.
4.2.6. Comparison communication delay, reliability, and CPU and memory
consumption metrics
In software-defined networking (SDN), it’s crucial to evaluate various metrics such as communication delay, reliability, CPU consumption, and memory consumption to ensure optimal network performance. This section provides a comparative analysis of these metrics
in different SDN strategies or configurations,as shown in Tables 4–7.
• Communication Delay: Communication delay refers to the time
taken for a message to travel from one point to another in
the network, encompassing transmission time, processing time,
and queuing time. Factors influencing communication delay include network topology, which can increase delays due to longer
paths and more hops, as well as the load balancing strategy,
with different strategies potentially requiring varying levels of
communication between controllers and switches.
• Reliability: Reliability is a crucial metric that measures the ability of the network to maintain consistent performance and availability, particularly in the face of failures or increased loads.

5. Conclusion:
This study aimed to address the challenges associated with controller load in software-defined networks (SDNs) by proposing a multilevel threshold approach for load balancing among controllers. The
findings demonstrate that the proposed method effectively measures
controller load using three critical metrics: CPU utilization, memory
consumption, and bandwidth usage. By accurately assessing the status

of controllers and strategically executing switch migration operations,
the proposed framework significantly reduces response times across
various traffic conditions compared to existing methods. Despite these
promising results, several challenges remain that warrant further exploration. Notably, the diversity in controller capacities can affect the
accuracy of load distribution, suggesting the need for more sophisticated algorithms capable of evaluating real-time controller capabilities.
Additionally, the costs associated with switch migration operations
pose a significant consideration; hence, future work should focus on
optimizing these processes to minimize overhead while maximizing
network efficiency.
Furthermore, the dynamic nature of network traffic necessitates the
development of intelligent algorithms that can adaptively manage and
distribute loads in real time. Incorporating machine learning techniques
for traffic prediction and adjustment of load distribution strategies
could be a valuable avenue for future research. In summary, this study
lays the groundwork for enhancing load balancing in SDNs through innovative methodologies. Continued research in the areas of scalability,
cost optimization, and adaptive load management will be essential for
advancing the effectiveness of SDN architectures, ultimately leading to
improved network performance and reliability.
